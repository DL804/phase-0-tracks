	<h1>Good morning, Dub Nation</h1>

	<p> Today, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Warriors-fans-gear-up-for-make-or-break-Game-7-8312145.php">our hearts are broken</a> after last night's defeat.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_spot/2016/06/17/ayesha_curry_alleges_nba_absolutely_rigged_for_money.html">LeBron and his Cavs were the better team</a> during Game 7, and so this year, they took home the championship.</p>
	<p>It stings to <a href="<a href="http://nyti.ms/1UhXbUF">not be able to finish the season</a> with a trophy, but we still have to give it up for our team.<p>
	<p>All season long, our Dubs <strong><em>SLAYYYYYYYYYED</em></strong> and despite the ending, it was a pure joy to watch this <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2647354-after-bending-nba-to-their-will-warriors-find-basketball-magic-has-its-limits">magical season</a>.</p>
