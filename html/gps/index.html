<!--Reflection questions

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Semantic tags are to help with organization and readability of code so that you can see what sort of content and structure you might expect based on what tag is used. I think tags like <article> and <aside> that seem less arbitrary are more useful. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
From top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned how to create snippets, which are code shortcuts. I'll definitely want to use that more in the future!

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I want to learn more about what meta charset means, and I don't quite have all the semantic tags differentiated yet. I will keep practicing and researching to better understand the concepts. The semantic tag flowchart is really helpful and short enough to try to memorize.
