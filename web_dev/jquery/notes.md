#Release 1 
I started with tutorials, figure out all the syntax, how it works. I spent about 30 minutes there, created my basic html page and started applying what I learned and testing while I read through each section. The last half hour or so, I found a youtube video which helped and also a cheatsheet too. 

If I didn't watch the videos toward the end, it'll probably take me longer to go through everything. A mix of video and online documentation seems to work for me.
